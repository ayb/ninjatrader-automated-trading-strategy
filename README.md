Inside Bar Strategy

Inside bars are formed when the current bar does not close above or below the previous bar.

This strategy identifies inside bars and send buy or sell orders if price breaks above or below the inside bar. It is fully automated, meaning it will send an order to open a position and immediately send a target limit and stop order to close the position. Additionally, it will move the stop order using Average True Range.

DO NOT USE REAL MONEY TO TRADE THIS STRATEGY.
